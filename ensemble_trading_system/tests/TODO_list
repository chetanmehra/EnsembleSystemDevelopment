
 High level work
- DONE - Define process for strategy execution
- DONE - Construct strategy with measure parameter set.
- DONE - Construct strategy with model parameter set
- DONE - Construct strategy with model and measure parameter sets
*Clean up modules names and associated classes

 New Features
- DONE - Add ability to plot long only, and short only results
- DONE - Strategy does not redo existing components on initialise
*Plot long and short results together
*Calculate performance metrics
- DONE - Strategy to produce label for self

 Error proofing
*Ensemble forecast mean to handle missing values.

 Refactoring
- DONE - Replace DataFrame and Panel builds with helper method constructions
- DONE - Weight for positions to be renamed to PositionSelector
- DONE - Move ind_timing from Measure to Strategy. Have strategy return required prices.
- DONE - Ensemble Strategy to contain sub-strategies instead of collections of forecasts etc.
*Speed up forecast window method.
*Maybe change strategy initialisation to require market input.
*Abstract out a data container object for use by market, models etc.

 Testing assertions specific to object type
- DONE - Indicator levels are appropriate data type (e.g. string)
- DONE - Testing for IndicatorMeasure
- DONE - Measure object must implement ind_timing parameter
- DONE - Confirm Forecast data is same content (ticker and dates) as input

 Interface definitions
- DONE - Indicator class definition
- DONE - Indicator implements __getitem__ method to allow index by ticker
- DONE - Supply indicator data when initiating
- DONE - PositionModel must return Position object
- DONE - Strategy to provide strat returns series.

 FIXES
- DONE - Change BlockForecaster execute method not require ticker
- DONE - Change Crossover execute method not require ticker
- DONE - PositionModel expects Forecast, whereas Strategy provides itself when calling model.
- DONE - Strategy.indicator returns DataFrame: conflict between object and need for indicator lag.
- DONE - Forecast optF method is generating infinities
- DONE - Position model is not able to handle NaN values
- DONE - Indicator.levels doesn't handle NaNs
- DONE - Returns shouldn't be shifted after initial calculation within Market.
- DONE - Indicator date shifts are incorrect.
- DONE - Positions need to be shifted when calculating strat returns.
